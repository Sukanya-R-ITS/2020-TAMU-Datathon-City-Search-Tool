Inspiration

When we first saw the website https://www.highspeedinternet.com/best-cities-to-live-work-remotely, we found that there were too many features to consider. Also, most importantly, since these days, people are worried about COVID-19, we included COVID-19 confirmed cases and death numbers to consider when they select cities. We carefully picked 8 important features Popluation_Density, Markets_Numbers , Educated_Score, Fastfood_Restaurant_Numbers, Covid19_Confirmed_Numbers, Covid19_Deaths_Numbers, Annual_Temperature, Crime_Rate, and our product will give choose the best 5 cities as suggestion.

What it does

Our project helps everyone to choose the best city to live based on 8 features such as crime rate, population density, covid infected count, count of deaths due to covid, restaurants available, number of grocery stores, and education index. We chose these features due to the importance of these features, which are normally ignored considering the other factors. 

How we built it

We built the project in various platforms such as VS code, Jupyter notebook and google colab. Using google colab helped us collaborate simultaneously.

Challenges we ran into

One of the main challenges we ran into is finding the best data source. It took around 7 solid hours to find the required data source. We ended up picking 11 data sources as comma separated value files. It was challenging to choose the features from all these datasets. The next big thing is classifying all the features in the file to rank, in order to choose the best city. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to understand the problem and work together as a group successfully. Even though we come from different schools and majors, we were able to utilize the skills of each of the contributors.

We learned about the basic statistical concepts and learnt from each other how to use the algorithms efficiently.
